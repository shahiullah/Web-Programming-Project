<p> Biology is central to comprehending today's most pressing concerns, from managing the 
    spread of infectious diseases to sustainably feeding a planet of more than seven billion 
    people to revitalizing biodiversity in habitats around the world. Explore the fascinating 
    interconnectedness among living things while exploring practical applications in agriculture,
    medicine, biotechnology, environmental protection, and conservation. </p> <br><br>

    <div id="flip">History of Biology</div>
    <div id="panel">The history of biology traces the study of the living world from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of biology as a 
      single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching 
      back to Ayurveda, ancient Egyptian medicine and the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was 
      further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna. During the European Renaissance and early modern 
      period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. 
      Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as 
      Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms.
      Antonie van Leeuwenhoek revealed by means of microscopy the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. 
      The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history 
      (although it entrenched the argument from design). Over the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as botany and zoology became 
      increasingly professional scientific disciplines.

      Lavoisier and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists 
      such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on 
      geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance 
      of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as 
      well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end 
      of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance 
      remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of Mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics by Thomas Hunt 
      Morgan and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the "neo-Darwinian synthesis". 
      New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after Watson and Crick proposed the structure of DNA. Following the establishment of the 
      Central Dogma and the cracking of the genetic code, biology was largely split between organismal biology—the fields that deal with whole 
      organisms and groups of organisms—and the fields related to cellular and molecular biology. By the late 20th century, new fields like 
      genomics and proteomics were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists
      investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms. </div> <br> <br>
