    <p> Geology is the study of planet Earth, its origin and evolution, its fundamental structure, the properties of minerals, rocks, and fluids of
      which it is composed, and the evolution of its biosphere. Studying geology is an opportunity to live and work in a beautiful natural geological 
      laboratory, getting to know earth's resources, it's beauty is literally at your doorstep. Geology involves integrating many aspects of the 
      physical and natural sciences to unravel the history and dynamics of our planet throughout geological time. Geologists are explorers and work 
      outdoors in the remarkable natural laboratory that are planet presents. Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any 
      terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences, including 
      hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated Earth system science and planetary science. 
      Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. </p>

    <p> It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the histories of those
      rocks.By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate 
      the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past 
      climates.
      Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including field work, rock description, 
      geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral
      and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental
      problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology is a major academic discipline, and it is central to geological engineering
      and plays an important role in geotechnical engineering.  </p>

<div id="flip"> <b> Historical Geology and Stratigraphy </b> </div>

<div id="panel"> One of the major objectives of geology is to establish the history of the Earth from its inception to the present. The most 
  important evidence from which geologic history can be inferred is provided by the geometric relationships of rocks with respect to each other,
  particularly layered rocks, or strata, the relative ages of which may be determined by applying simple principles. One of the major principles
  of stratigraphy is that within a sequence of layers of sedimentary rock, the oldest layer is at the base and that the layers are progressively 
  younger with ascending order in the sequence. This is termed the law of superposition and is one of the great general principles of geology. 
  Ordinarily, beds of sedimentary rocks are deposited more or less horizontally. In some regions sedimentary strata have remained more or less
  horizontal long after they were deposited. Some of these sedimentary rocks were deposited in shallow seas that once extended over large areas 
  of the present continents. In many places sedimentary rocks lie much above sea level, reflecting vertical shift of the crust relative to sea 
  level. In regions where the rocks have been strongly deformed through folding or faulting, the original attitudes of strata may be greatly 
  altered, and sequences of strata that were once essentially horizontal may now be steeply inclined or overturned. <br><br><br> 

  Prior to the development of radiometric methods of dating rocks, the ages of rocks and other geologic features could not be expressed 
  quantitatively, or as numbers of years, but instead were expressed solely in terms of relative ages, in which the age of a particular geologic 
  feature could be expressed as relatively younger or older than other geologic features. The ages of different sequences of strata, for example, 
  can be compared with each other in this manner, and their relative ages with respect to faults, igneous intrusions, and other features that 
  exhibit crosscutting relationships can be established. Given such a network of relative ages, a chronology of events has been gradually established
  in which the relative time of origin of various geologic features is known. This is the main thread of historical geology—an ordered sequence 
  of geologic events whose occurrence and relative ages have been inferred from evidence preserved in the rocks. In turn, the development of 
  radiometric dating methods has permitted numerical estimates of age to be incorporated in the scale of geologic time. <br><br><br> 

  The development of the mass spectrometer has provided researchers with a means of calculatig quantitative ages for rocks throughout the 
  whole of the geologic record. With the aid of various radiometric methods involving mass spectrometric analysis, researchers have found it 
  possible to determine how long ago a particular sediment was deposited, when an igneous rock crystallized or when a metamorphic rock 
  recrystallized, and even the time at which rocks in a mountain belt cooled or underwent uplift. Radiometric dating also helped geochronologists 
  discover the vast span of geologic time. The radiometric dating of meteorites revealed that the Earth, like other bodies of the solar system,
  is about 4,600,000,000 years old, the oldest minerals (detrital zircons of Western Australia) are 4,400,000,000 to 4,100,000,000 years old,
  and the oldest rocks discovered so far (the faux amphibolites located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Canada) formed roughly 4,280,000,000 
  years ago. It has been established that the Precambrian time occupies seven-eighths of geologic time, but the era is still poorly understood in 
  comparison with the Phanerozoic Eon—the span of time extending from about the beginning of the Cambrian Period to the Holocene Epoch during 
  which complex life forms are known to have existed. The success of dating Phanerozoic time with some degree of precision has depended on the 
  interlinking of radiometric ages with biostratigraphy, which is the correlation of strata with fossils. </div> <br> <br>
